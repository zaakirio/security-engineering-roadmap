# Weeks 11-12: Capstone Projects, Certifications & Job Prep

## Key Learning Objectives
- Synthesize skills: Full AppSec workflow.
- Prep resume/portfolio.
- Network.

## Resources & Labs
- Cert: CompTIA Security+ (study Sybex book, free practice tests on ExamCram; aim to pass in Week 12).
- Job Prep: Update CV to highlight security angles (e.g., "Integrated secure APIs in Zing Dev role"). LinkedIn outreach to AppSec pros.
- Labs: Bug bounty platforms (HackerOne, expand your methodology).

## Side Project/Milestone
Capstone: Create an "AppSec Toolkit" repoâ€”scripts for auto-scanning, a threat model template, and a secured microservice app. Hunt/fix bugs in open-source repos (report via GitHub issues). Update blog with 2-3 new posts (e.g., tool reviews). Apply to 10+ jobs weekly, tailoring with portfolio links. This builds a showcase of end-to-end AppSec work.
