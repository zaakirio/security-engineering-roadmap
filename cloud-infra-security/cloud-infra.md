# Weeks 7-8: Cloud & Infrastructure Security

## Key Learning Objectives
- Secure cloud setups (AWS/GCP/Azure): IAM, encryption, logging.
- Intro to container security (Docker).
- Basics of infra monitoring.

## Resources & Labs
- Free: AWS Security Hub docs, GCP Security Command Center, Azure Security Center.
- Labs: TryHackMe (Cloud Security rooms), qwiklabs (free AWS/GCP security quests).
- Videos: Cloud Security Podcast on YouTube.

## Side Project/Milestone
Deploy a sample app (your VulnApp from Week 1) to AWS/EC2 or GCP. Secure it: Enable MFA, encrypt data, set up CloudWatch logs. Simulate an attack (e.g., misconfig exploit) and mitigate. Document as a "Cloud Sec Hardening Guide" on blog/GitHub. This replicates real cloud config reviews.
