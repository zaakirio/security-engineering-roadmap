# Weeks 1-2: Cybersecurity Foundations & AppSec Basics

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand core concepts: CIA triad, common threats, OWASP Top 10.
- Learn web/app vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, auth bypass).
- Review networking basics (HTTP/HTTPS, firewalls).

## Resources & Labs
- Free: OWASP Cheat Sheets, PortSwigger Web Security Academy (Burp Suite basics).
- Labs: TryHackMe (Intro to Cyber Security room), HackTheBox Academy (Web Attacks module).
- Videos: YouTube channels like LiveOverflow or John Hammond.

## Side Project/Milestone
Build a simple vulnerable web app using Next.js/React/TS (e.g., login form with SQLi/XSS flaws). Document vulns on your blog, mimicking a real vuln report. Fix them with input validation/sanitizationâ€”upload to GitHub as "VulnApp-Demo". This showcases secure coding from day-to-day dev reviews.
