# Security Engineering Roadmap

This Markdown file contains a 12-week curriculum tailored for transitioning to a Security Engineer/AppSec role coming from a Software Engineering background

| Week    | Focus Area                          | Key Learning Objectives                                                                 | Resources & Labs                                                                                          | Side Project/Milestone                                                                                     |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2     | Cybersecurity Foundations & AppSec Basics | Understand core concepts: CIA triad, common threats, OWASP Top 10. Learn web/app vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, auth bypass). Review networking basics (HTTP/HTTPS, firewalls). | - Free: OWASP Cheat Sheets, PortSwigger Web Security Academy (Burp Suite basics).<br>- Labs: TryHackMe (Intro to Cyber Security room), HackTheBox Academy (Web Attacks module).<br>- Videos: YouTube channels like LiveOverflow or John Hammond. | Build a simple vulnerable web app using Next.js/React/TS (e.g., login form with SQLi/XSS flaws). Document vulns on your blog, mimicking a real vuln report. Fix them with input validation/sanitization—upload to GitHub as "VulnApp-Demo". This showcases secure coding from day-to-day dev reviews. |
| 3-4     | Secure Coding & Vulnerability Assessment | Dive into secure coding in your languages (TS/Python/Node.js): Input validation, encryption, auth (JWT/OAuth). Practice code reviews for security. Intro to cryptography basics. | - Free: OWASP Secure Coding Practices, Mozilla Web Security docs.<br>- Labs: PortSwigger (free labs on XSS, CSRF), Semgrep Academy for code scanning.<br>- Book: "Web Application Hacker's Handbook" (skim chapters). | Audit and refactor one of your past projects for security. Add secure auth, fix potential issues. Create a "Security Audit Report" Markdown on GitHub/blog, including before/after code snippets. This emulates AppSec code review tasks. |
| 5-6     | Security Testing Tools & Penetration Testing | Master SAST/DAST/SCA tools. Learn manual pentesting for apps. Automate basic scans.         | - Free: Install OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Community, Snyk (free tier).<br>- Labs: HackTheBox (web machines like your CozyHosting write-up), DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App) for practice.<br>- Course: Udemy "Ethical Hacking" (under $20, focus on web sections). | Set up a local web app (Python Flask or Node.js) and run scans: Use ZAP for DAST, Semgrep for SAST. Fix found issues, automate in a script. Blog a write-up like your HTB posts, but for your app—title it "AppSec Testing Pipeline Demo". Push to GitHub; this mirrors daily vuln scanning in production. |
| 7-8     | Cloud & Infrastructure Security     | Secure cloud setups (AWS/GCP/Azure): IAM, encryption, logging. Intro to container security (Docker). Basics of infra monitoring. | - Free: AWS Security Hub docs, GCP Security Command Center, Azure Security Center.<br>- Labs: TryHackMe (Cloud Security rooms), qwiklabs (free AWS/GCP security quests).<br>- Videos: Cloud Security Podcast on YouTube. | Deploy a sample app (your VulnApp from Week 1) to AWS/EC2 or GCP. Secure it: Enable MFA, encrypt data, set up CloudWatch logs. Simulate an attack (e.g., misconfig exploit) and mitigate. Document as a "Cloud Sec Hardening Guide" on blog/GitHub. This replicates real cloud config reviews. |
| 9-10    | DevSecOps & Advanced AppSec         | Integrate security in CI/CD. Threat modeling (STRIDE/DREAD). Compliance basics (GDPR). API security. | - Free: OWASP DevSecOps Guideline, GitHub Security docs.<br>- Labs: Set up GitHub Actions with security scans (Trivy for containers, Bandit for Python).<br>- Course: Coursera "DevOps and Software Engineering" (free audit, security modules). | Build a CI/CD pipeline for a full-stack app (React frontend, Python/Node backend). Add security gates: SAST in build, dependency checks. Threat model the app (diagram risks). Repo on GitHub: "DevSecOps-Pipeline-Project". Blog about it, linking to your bug bounty methodology for real-world tie-in. This shows pipeline security, a core AppSec duty. |
| 11-12   | Capstone Projects, Certifications & Job Prep | Synthesize skills: Full AppSec workflow. Prep resume/portfolio. Network.                   | - Cert: CompTIA Security+ (study Sybex book, free practice tests on ExamCram; aim to pass in Week 12).<br>- Job Prep: Update CV to highlight security angles (e.g., "Integrated secure APIs in Zing Dev role"). LinkedIn outreach to AppSec pros.<br>- Labs: Bug bounty platforms (HackerOne, expand your methodology). | Capstone: Create an "AppSec Toolkit" repo—scripts for auto-scanning, a threat model template, and a secured microservice app. Hunt/fix bugs in open-source repos (report via GitHub issues). Update blog with 2-3 new posts (e.g., tool reviews). Apply to 10+ jobs weekly, tailoring with portfolio links. This builds a showcase of end-to-end AppSec work. |

## Tips for Success
- Track progress: Use a Notion/Kanban board for weekly tasks.
- Portfolio: Host all projects on GitHub, link from blog. Emphasize quantifiable impacts.
- Networking: Join Discord/Slack for AppSec, attend virtual meetups.
- Time Management: Dedicate 50% to learning, 50% to projects.
- Quick Wins: Add 1-2 more HTB/THM write-ups per month.
