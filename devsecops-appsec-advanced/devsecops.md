# Weeks 9-10: DevSecOps & Advanced AppSec

## Key Learning Objectives
- Integrate security in CI/CD.
- Threat modeling (STRIDE/DREAD).
- Compliance basics (GDPR).
- API security.

## Resources & Labs
- Free: [OWASP DevSecOps](https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/latest) Guideline, GitHub Security docs.
- Labs: Set up GitHub Actions with security scans (Trivy for containers, Bandit for Python).
- Course: Coursera "DevOps and Software Engineering" (free audit, security modules).

## Side Project/Milestone
Build a CI/CD pipeline for a full-stack app (React frontend, Python/Node backend). Add security gates: SAST in build, dependency checks. Threat model the app (diagram risks). Repo on GitHub: "DevSecOps-Pipeline-Project". Blog about it, linking to your bug bounty methodology for real-world tie-in. This shows pipeline security, a core AppSec duty.
