# Weeks 5-6: Security Testing Tools & Penetration Testing

## Key Learning Objectives
- Master SAST/DAST/SCA tools.
- Learn manual pentesting for apps.
- Automate basic scans.

## Resources & Labs
- Free: Install OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Community, Snyk (free tier).
- Labs: HackTheBox (web machines like your CozyHosting write-up), DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App) for practice.
- Course: Udemy "Ethical Hacking" (under $20, focus on web sections).

## Side Project/Milestone
Set up a local web app (Python Flask or Node.js) and run scans: Use ZAP for DAST, Semgrep for SAST. Fix found issues, automate in a script. Blog a write-up like your HTB posts, but for your appâ€”title it "AppSec Testing Pipeline Demo". Push to GitHub; this mirrors daily vuln scanning in production.
