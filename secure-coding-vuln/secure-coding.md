# Weeks 3-4: Secure Coding & Vulnerability Assessment

## Key Learning Objectives
- Dive into secure coding in your languages (TS/Python/Node.js): Input validation, encryption, auth (JWT/OAuth).
- Practice code reviews for security.
- Intro to cryptography basics.

## Resources & Labs
- Free: OWASP Secure Coding Practices, Mozilla Web Security docs.
- Labs: PortSwigger (free labs on XSS, CSRF), Semgrep Academy for code scanning.
- Book: "Web Application Hacker's Handbook" (skim chapters).

## Side Project/Milestone
Audit and refactor one of your past projects (e.g., from Admanage.ai or Legal500 experience) for security. Add secure auth, fix potential issues. Create a "Security Audit Report" Markdown on GitHub/blog, including before/after code snippets. This emulates AppSec code review tasks.
